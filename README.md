Time Series Analysis on ISRO
🚀 ISRO Mission Time Series Analysis & Forecasting
📌 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth time series analysis of ISRO space missions to understand historical trends and forecast future patterns. Using mission-wise data such as launch year, launch vehicle (PSLV, GSLV), mission type, success status, and budget, the project uncovers insights into ISRO’s growth, reliability, and technological evolution over time.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze launch trends across years for PSLV and GSLV series

Study mission success rates using time-based patterns

Identify budget growth trends in Indian Rupees

Forecast future mission launches using ARIMA time series modeling
